# How to use these
Press F12 on The Blooket website, and then go to console and paste whatever hack or tool you want to use in there and press enter.

# for mobile
Some of these scripts dont work with this, but copy the Code from whatever hack or tool you want to use, and go to https://caiorss.github.io/bookmarklet-maker/ . Then paste the code from the script in "Code" where the alert thing is (remove that beforehand) and then press *Generate Bookmarklet.* It will take a bit and then copy the output you get.
